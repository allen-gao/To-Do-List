To-Do-List
==========

A simple site created with JQuery that lets you add and remove tasks on a "to-do list". You can check out the site here: http://allen-to-do-list.appspot.com/ 

Note that your list contents are stored with the instance of the browser page you have opened. If you were looking for something that stores content across sessions and/or linked to an account, keep an eye out for progress on ClouDo, which is that and so much more!
